# Paperbox

Send things to yourself.

## Description

If you are using more than 1 device, then this app is for you!

Sometimes we like to send things to ourself using chat apps or by email because it helps us transfer text or media to another device of ours. However, sending things to ourself using chat apps requires us to login our account on another device which often means loading our chat messages to that device. This is not desirable because our private messages get saved on a foreign device. Not only that, chat apps usually are so full-fledged that they take time to load up. Somemore, we even need to take extra care not to send things to the wrong people.

Paperbox lets you send things to YOURSELF with ease and confidence!
